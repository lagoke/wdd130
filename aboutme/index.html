    <h2>Olagoke Amiola</h2>
    <p>Hi Everyone, My name is Olagoke Amiola. Many people call me Gk. It is pretty easier.
        <br> I am originally from Nigeria. I currently reside in Atlanta, USA.
        <br> My background is in finance, but  I am excited to start this journey at BYU by studying Applied Technology.
        <br> I like to play soccer both in real life and in video games, among a few others. </p>
