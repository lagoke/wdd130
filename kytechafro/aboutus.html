            A discussion of how Knowyourtechafro.com came to fruition will be made.
            A story that begins with watching my fellow Africans struggle with finding occupations when they relocate to the United States.There are many stories about spending months to years trying to figure out how and what to do to make a living.
            This is where Knowyourtechafro.com comes in. For the ones that are interested in anything IT, Knowyourtechafro.com is where to go. We will provide an area that has information about all things IT.
            Whether database, application, design, testing, etc.
            Kytechafro.com will market to Africans and others who come to the US and other areas of the Western World to pursue an education. 
            The site will primarily be for college-age students and up and will be for all income levels. Knowyourtechafro.com is going to be the hub. 
            A place where first-hand information will be available to its members, there will be several trainers for different courses and there will be a healthy competitiveness in training quality and price for training.
            The trainers that will be allowed to be on our website are going to be certified.The trainers will be vetted and we will make sure they will provide high-quality training for the members of our site.
            They have to have enough experience and knowledge of what they will be training on. It will be an interview process for all the trainers and they will sign a contract before we can put them on our site.
            This contract will entail what will be expected of them. When it comes to questions about the trending IT programs for new and experienced IT professionals it will be a place to get answers to all your questions.
            There will be a section where members can get evaluated to determine the IT field that is best suited for them. And training on our website will depend on each person’s interests, strengths, and what they can afford to pay for training at that time.
            We will also provide tutoring and assistance for members to take their certification exams in their chosen fields.
