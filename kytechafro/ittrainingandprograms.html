            Activities on the website will include training information, IT training sites, information about training, and a forum to discuss everything IT.
            Space will also be provided where we will tailor curriculums for different IT programs. This will be different from the training programs and will be free.
            This will be for the members that can’t afford any paid training program but want some type of experience.
            As the site grows, we hope to be able to provide more free materials that will be beneficial to the members.
            There will be a simple sign-up process to get into our site, members will be required to provide their contact information,
            which is simply their names, country of residence, email addresses, and contact phone number. They will need to answer 10 quick easy questions.
            After this is done, an email will be sent to their email with a username (the member’s email) and a temporary password. A link to sign in to the site will be provided.
            Once they sign in to the site, it will alert them to change their password and get started with the site.
            The benefit of being a member of knowyourtechafro.com will be the ability to have everything you need to start an IT career in one place,
            the website is open to everyone but the focus will be a strong African community where we can build off one another.
            It will be well-categorized, and there will be materials, curriculums, and trainers for different areas of IT,
            for example, and, there will be part of our website dedicated strictly to the cloud, database, front and backend development, project management, etc.
