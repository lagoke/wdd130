      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I will be talking about the latest news in the IT world,
        people can choose the right IT Path for them. Especially my fellow Africans.
        Many of us come to the US and the western world not being sure of what IT Path to take,
        This website will create information, and educational materials, for example, there are security, development, architectural,
        and business analysis areas, etc.
        We will discuss how to choose the IT Path and program that is best for you and the best place to achieve that knowledge, regardless of your age,
        educational and technological background. It will us also act as a platform for IT Course Trainers and schools to advertise their service.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>
        A discussion of how Knowyourtechafro.com came to fruition will be made. A story that begins with watching my fellow Africans struggle with finding occupations when they relocate to the United States. There are many stories about spending months to years trying to figure out how and what to do to make a living. This is where Knowyourtechafro.com comes in. For the ones that are interested in anything IT, Knowyourtechafro.com is where to go. We will provide an area that has information about all things IT. Whether database, application, design, testing, etc. Kytechafro.com will market to Africans and others who come to the US and other areas of the Western World to pursue an education. The site will primarily be for college-age students and up and will be for all income levels.

Knowyourtechafro.com is going to be the hub. A place where first-hand information will be available to its members, there will be several trainers for different courses and there will be a healthy competitiveness in training quality and price for training. The trainers that will be allowed to be on our website are going to be certified. The trainers will be vetted and we will make sure they will provide high-quality training for the members of our site. They have to have enough experience and knowledge of what they will be training on. It will be an interview process for all the trainers and they will sign a contract before we can put them on our site. This contract will entail what will be expected of them.
When it comes to questions about the trending IT programs for new and experienced IT professionals it will be a place to get answers to all your questions. There will be a section where members can get evaluated to determine the IT field that is best suited for them. And training on our website will depend on each person’s interests, strengths, and what they can afford to pay for training at that time. We will also provide tutoring and assistance for members to take their certification exams in their chosen fields.

      <h3>IT PROGRAMS AND TRAINING</h3>
      <p>
        Activities on the website will include training information, IT training sites, information about training, and a forum to discuss everything IT. Space will also be provided where we will tailor curriculums for different IT programs. This will be different from the training programs and will be free. This will be for the members that can’t afford any paid training program but want some type of experience. As the site grows, we hope to be able to provide more free materials that will be beneficial to the members. 
There will be a simple sign-up process to get into our site, members will be required to provide their contact information, which is simply their names, country of residence, email addresses, and contact phone number. They will need to answer 10 quick easy questions. After this is done, an email will be sent to their email with a username (the member’s email) and a temporary password. A link to sign in to the site will be provided.  Once they sign in to the site, it will alert them to change their password and get started with the site.

The benefit of being a member of knowyourtechafro.com will be the ability to have everything you need to start an IT career in one place, the website is open to everyone but the focus will be a strong African community where we can build off one another. It will be well-categorized, and there will be materials, curriculums, and trainers for different areas of IT, for example, and, there will be part of our website dedicated strictly to the cloud, database, front and backend development, project management, etc.
